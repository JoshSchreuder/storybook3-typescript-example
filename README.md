## Storybook 3 TypeScript example

A sample repo showing how I got Storybook 3 up and running with TypeScript.

I detailed my process [on my blog](http://www.joshschreuder.me/react-storybooks-with-typescript/), beginning with `create-react-app` and `storybook`. Everything here is untouched from a default `storybook` installation, apart from converting what is generated by `getstorybook` to TypeScript.

### Getting started
`yarn install` or `npm install`

`yarn run storybook` or `npm run storybook`
